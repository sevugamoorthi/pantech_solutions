# Object Recognition using MobileNet SSD

A Python project for **real-time object detection** using OpenCV and **MobileNet SSD**.  
This project can detect multiple common objects like **person, car, dog, bottle, chair, etc.** using pre-trained Caffe models.

## üìå Features
- Real-time object detection from **images, videos, or webcam**.
- Uses **MobileNet SSD** pre-trained model with Caffe framework.
- Lightweight and fast, suitable for real-time applications.
- Detects multiple object classes with bounding boxes and labels.
